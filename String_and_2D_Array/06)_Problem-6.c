/// Problem Statement:
/*
How much bytes does an int type array with 12 elements take in memory?
*/

/// My Solution
We know, Total memory allocated to an Integer Array (single dimensional) of N elements = Number of elements * size of one element
= N * 4 bytes [Int type array allocates 4 bytes for one element]
= 12 * 4 bytes = 48 Bytes, where N = 12

So, An int type array with 12 elements take 48 bytes in memory.
