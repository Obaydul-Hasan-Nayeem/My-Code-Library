    <> Basic Info:
        - Heap is a complete binary tree [last level bade baki shokol level filled]

    <> Types:
        - maxheap: current node value >= all below nodes value // Max Heap is a binary tree where every node has a value greater than or equal to it's children
        - minheap: current node value <= all below nodes value


    <> Operations:
        insert(x) -> O(log n)
        max / min -> O(1)
        delete    -> O(log n)
