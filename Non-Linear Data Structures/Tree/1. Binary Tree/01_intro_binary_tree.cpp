/*
</> Binary Tree

    > Characteristics / other info:
        - maximum number of nodes of the n-th level: 2^n

    > Conditions:
        - at most 2 child
        - each node has single parent, root has no parent
        - no cycle (acyclic)

    > Types:
        - Full Binary Tree [every node has 0 or 2 child]
        - Complete Binary Tree [without last level, all are filled with child]
        - Perfect Binary Tree [all levels are filled]
            Here, minimum number of nodes = 2^h - 1 [h = height of the tree or the number of levels counting from 0]

        [All perfect binary tree are complete / (full binary tree)]

    > Traversals of Binary Tree:
        - BFS (Breadth First Search)
        - DFS (Depth First Search)
