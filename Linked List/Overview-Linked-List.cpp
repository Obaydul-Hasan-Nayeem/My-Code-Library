    # Basic:
        - A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, with each element pointing to the next element.


    # Characteristics:
        - Linear data structure (array also linear)
        - Dynamic data structure (array is static)
        - Linked List can utilize memory. But array can't efficiently.
        - Array is not perfect to work with >10^8. But linked list can.
          That means, linked list can work with big data
        - Is needed for more DS: stack, queue, dequeue

    #
        - Nodes in Linked List = Data (int / string / object) and Pointer
        -


    #
        - Linked List Structure
        - Insertion at head
        - Search for values

    # Cons. of Linked List:
        - To access any memory of the index, it needs O(n)
          but array needs O(1). In Array, Index Position of array: start address + index * 4
        - As linked list needs O(n) to access any index, so, it is not perfect for binary search.
          Because, it'll need O(nlogn). But in array, it needs only O(logn).
          So, we'll not use linked list for binary search. Only for linear search.
        - Here, binary search is not good. We have to use only linear search.

    # Time Complexity:
        - Insert a value at head: O(1)
        - Search a value: O(n)
        - Binary Search: O(nlogn)
